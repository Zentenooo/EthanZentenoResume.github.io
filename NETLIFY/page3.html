        <h3>Student Worker, University at Albany Library</h3>
<p>The job differs day by day, so if im on desk ill help patrons by scanning books
        in for them or retunring books they checked out. I also help them find books
        or find places in the library I also give out study rooms, and besides the desk I also work upstairs helping
        sort the inventory and shelve books that need to be put back.</p>    
        
        
            <h3>Treetop Ranger, WCS Bronx Zoo</h3>
       <p>Ensured visitor safety and enjoyment on treetop courses and on the
        harder courses I gave people tips to get through
        or had to go up on the course to help and in serious cases lower them off the course.
         I also helped send people and catch people at the bottom of ziplines and obstacles.
          Operated zipline equipment, handled challenging situations like having to go out on the zip and save people if they got stuck or didnt hit the brake
          , and provided exceptional customer service and comfort in tough and tense situations.</p>

        <p>Created a dynamic learning environment for Pre-K children, mediated conflicts,
        and helped them learn social skills and showed them how to make up with eachother
        and also helped facilitate fun games.I also gained alot of skill in human interaction
        not only with the kids but dealing with parents after tense days or if they had a problem
        as well as other teachers due to schedling.</p>
